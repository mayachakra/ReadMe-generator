# README Generator

  ## Description
    Using node.js, I worked on prompting user entry on CLI and then using that to create a README page.
  ## Installation
    To do this I first worked on the index.js where I made an array of preset questions, write to the README file and then initialize it to then generate the file while also having another js file called generateMarkdown in order to create the format as well as a function to create the license agreement with a badge.
  ## Usage
  It can be used when opening an integrated terminal with the index.js file and running 'node index.js' in the CLI so the user can answer the questions and then will be met with a README file.
  ## Credits
   I utilized previous notes, asked questions to AI about how to approach certain problems such as the license functions, a git site to find the badge links, and npmjs.com for the inquirer portion.
  ## Features
  It utilizes file writing, arrays for the questions, function to initialize and generate the markdown as well as functions to create the license section
  ## License
    
    This is licensed unded the  license.
